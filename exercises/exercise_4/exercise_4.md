## Objective
Create a correlation heatmap showing the relationship between team wins and various performance metrics:
- Runs scored
- Runs allowed
- Home runs
- Stolen bases
- Errors
- Team batting average
- Team ERA

Use appropriate color scaling and annotations to show correlation coefficients.

## Visualization Requirements
- Create a correlation matrix heatmap using seaborn or matplotlib
- Include correlation coefficients as annotations on each cell

## Success Criteria
- Properly labeled with titles, axis labels, and legends
- Plot is appropriately sized and styled for readability
- Correlation coefficients are clearly visible and readable
- Color scale effectively represents correlation strength and direction
